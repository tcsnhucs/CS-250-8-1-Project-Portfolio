# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The best way to go about this is to make sure you completely understand that you are following the user's needs. If you ever have any questions regarding a specific need of the user, you should ask a question for clarity. The user stories allow for the user to write exact needs in specific ways so that clarity of needs can be put up front before the question is asked.
# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I hope to work in the development field and this course has taught me that agile development is the most efficient way to develop a product. This means I hope to work on an agile scrum team once I graduate, and thus incorperate the things I've learned in this course into my proffession.
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means being able to communicate needs clearly, help others whenever they need help, and produce work in a manor that keeps up production schedual and allows for the product to be successfully produced.
